# Welcome to My GIS & Geospatial Data Science Portfolio 

## About Me

I am Mudasirullah Stanikzai, a geoscience and GIS/geospatial data science professional with over 3 years of experience applying GIS in the earth science field.  
Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have applied GIS technology to both research and applied projects.  

I hold a **Master’s degree in Earth Resources Science** and am currently pursuing a **Graduate Certificate in CyberGIS and Geospatial Data Science**.  

This portfolio highlights a selection of my personal and academic projects in cartography, remote sensing, and geospatial data science.  
It does not reflect all of my work — if you would like to learn more about my GIS work, please reach out via the **Contact** section.
